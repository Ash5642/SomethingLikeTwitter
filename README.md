Project based on Django Rest Framework (DRF)

-Frontend is a fully functional Single Page App (SPA) made with only JavaScript/HTML. Uses pure **vanilla JS** DOM malipulation to provide navigation between pages without reload, a tab system and real time content changes.

-Uses AI to provide translations for both UI and user content, including text, images, videos, etc. Image translation provides a toggleable overlay of extracted and translated text over original image. Frontend is dynamically loaded using a list of tokens for all text elements.

-May contain sensitive keys for old depricated AWS and Twilio accounts.

-Bult during COVID, around 2021-2022 (in 11th grade). Peak usercount: 3,000 with ~250 accounts. 

-Code quality is gargabe. Built in short bursts, sometimes while tweaking out.
